GA run on 31/07/2015.

This was done on 16_8 dataset, on the average. It used the exponenet 1.2, rather than 2, in the objective, to see if it made a difference.

It came out with a different theta than the average using exponent of 2, but the curves these two sets of parameters give are very similar, and there are still oscialltions in the residuals.

Suspect the parameters are very underdetermined.
